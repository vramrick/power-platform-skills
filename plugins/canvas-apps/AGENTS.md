# AGENTS.md — Canvas Apps Plugin

This file provides guidance to AI Agents when working with the **canvas-apps** plugin.

## What This Plugin Is

A plugin for authoring Power Apps Canvas Apps. The Canvas Authoring MCP server (`CanvasAuthoringMcpServer`) exposes tools that agents use to generate, validate, and compile Canvas App YAML files (`.pa.yaml`) in conjunction with a running coauthoring studio session. The Power Apps Studio browser tab must remain open for the duration of the session — closing it ends the coauthoring session, which breaks `compile_canvas` and `sync_canvas` operations.

Skills orchestrate specialist agents via the `Task` tool. Agents are not invoked directly by users.

## Local Development

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/canvas-app` | Create or edit a Canvas App — auto-detects whether to generate from scratch or edit existing |
| `/configure-canvas-mcp` | Configure the Canvas Authoring MCP server for the current coauthoring session |
| `/add-data-source` | Guide the user to add a data source, connection, or API connector in Studio, then verify it is available |

## Agents

Agents are invoked by skills via the `Task` tool — they are not user-invocable.

| Agent | Invoked By | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `canvas-app-planner` | `canvas-app` | Receives the approved plan from the skill. Discovers available controls, APIs, and data sources; gathers control property definitions (`describe_control`); writes `App.pa.yaml` (CREATE mode) and `canvas-app-plan.md` for downstream screen builders. |
| `canvas-screen-builder` | `canvas-app` | For Create actions: writes YAML for one new screen based on the plan. For Modify actions: applies targeted edits to one existing screen. Runs in parallel with other builders; validation is performed later by `canvas-app` using `compile_canvas`. |

## MCP Tools

The `canvas-authoring` MCP server exposes the following tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `configure` | Configures the MCP server for a specific coauthoring session (environment ID, app ID, cluster category) |
| `compile_canvas` | Validates canvas app YAML files in a directory using the Power Apps authoring service |
| `describe_api` | Gets detailed information about a specific API (connector) including its operations and parameters |
| `describe_control` | Gets detailed information about a specific Power Apps control including properties, variants, and metadata |
| `get_data_source_schema` | Gets the schema (columns and their Power Fx types) for a specific data source in the current authoring session |
| `list_apis` | Lists all available APIs (connectors) in the current authoring session |
| `list_controls` | Lists all available Power Apps controls in the current authoring session |
| `list_data_sources` | Lists all available data sources in the current authoring session |
| `sync_canvas` | Syncs the current coauthoring session state from the server to a local directory, writing all YAML files |

## Prerequisites

Before the MCP server will start, you need:

**.NET 10 SDK** — [Download from Microsoft](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)
